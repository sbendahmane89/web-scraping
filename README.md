# Module 11 Challenge: 

Web Scraping

## Challenge Overview:

The goal of this challenge is to practice web scraping and data analysis, strengthening skills in data collection, organization, analysis, and visual communication. This project involves two primary tasks:

1. Scrape Mars News Titles and Previews:

- Use automated browsing to access the Mars news site and scrape article titles and preview text.
- Store each title-preview pair in a dictionary and gather all dictionaries into a list.
- Optionally, export the data to a JSON file for easy sharing.

2. Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data:

- Visit the Mars Temperature Data site and scrape weather data from the HTML table using Beautiful Soup.
- Organize the data into a Pandas DataFrame, including columns for ID, terrestrial date, Martian days (sol), solar longitude, Martian month, minimum temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
- Review and convert data types as needed to ensure accuracy.
